tdd-light-scheduler-refactor
===============

## Instructions
In this exercise you are given a completed implementation off the TDD light scheduler exercise.  However, the code quality is poor and no refactoring has been done.  Refactor the light scheduler implementation and the tests to improve readability, reduce redundancy, and reduce the size of the source code.  At each step, be sure to make sure that the tests continue to pass -- do not do all of your refactoring and then try to make the tests pass at the end.

In order to build and run your tests, you can either execute _make_ from a terminal or press ctrl+B in Eclipse to build and run the tests.
